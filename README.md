Text Modelling on US Presidential election 2012 speeches

We have downloaded some speeches by B. Obama and M. Romney made during US Presidential election 2012. The speeches are uploaded on GitHUB and we would try to find some imortant topics each of their speeches consisted of. We will do Topic modelling using Gensim and visualize these topics using a womderful package called pyLDAvis.
